        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>James had always been a shy and introverted person, and so when his friend invited him to a party, he was hesitant to go. But something inside him told him that he should give it a try, and so he found himself at a crowded house party, feeling out of place and awkward.<br><br>

            As James stood in a corner, watching the people around him, he noticed a girl sitting alone on a couch. She was beautiful, with long brown hair and piercing blue eyes. James felt drawn to her, and before he knew it, he was walking over to her.<br><br>
            
            "Hi," he said, his voice trembling slightly. "I'm James."<br><br>
            
            The girl looked up at him and smiled. "I'm Anna," she said.<br><br>
            
            They started talking, and soon James found himself completely engrossed in their conversation. It was as if they had known each other for years. And when the party was over, James found himself walking Anna home.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1 : Coffee Date</h2>
        <p>James and Anna went on a coffee date a few days after the party. Anna had suggested a cute little coffee shop that she loved, and James agreed to meet her there. When he arrived, he saw Anna sitting at a table by the window, her face lit up in a smile as she saw him.<br><br>

            They ordered their drinks and settled in for a long conversation. Anna talked about her love for coffee, and in particular, her favorite drink - hot vanilla bean coffee. James listened intently, fascinated by the way Anna spoke about the simple pleasures in life.<br><br>
            
            As they chatted, James felt himself becoming more and more drawn to Anna. There was something about her that made him feel alive and excited, like he was experiencing the world in a new way. They talked about everything from their favorite books to their childhood memories, and James felt like he was finally getting to know someone who really understood him.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2 : Suck In</h2>
        <p>As James and Anna continued to text each other, their conversations became more and more intimate. They talked about their hopes and dreams, their fears and doubts, and shared their deepest secrets with each other. James found himself becoming more and more attached to Anna, and couldn't wait to see her again.<br><br>

            But as the days passed, James began to feel more and more disconnected from the world around him. He found it difficult to concentrate on his work, and his friends began to notice that something was off about him. They would ask him what was wrong, but he would just brush them off with a vague smile and say that everything was fine.<br><br>
            
            One night, as James was texting Anna, he suddenly realized that he hadn't actually received a reply from her. He had been texting her for hours, pouring his heart out to her, but she had never responded. He scrolled back through their conversation and saw that all of the messages he had sent had come from his own number.<br><br>
            
            Confused and frightened, James put down his phone and tried to make sense of what had just happened. Had he been hallucinating? Or was something else going on? As he sat in his apartment, alone with his thoughts, he began to feel a creeping sense of dread. Something was not right. We just texted to meet at the coffee shop a few days back but I can't find the convo.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3 : Opening Up</h2>
        <p>One day, while Doctor Brown was at a coffee shop, he noticed a young man named James who seemed to be struggling with something. James ordered two glass of coffee, hot vanilla bean in particular but only drank from one, leaving the other untouched. Doctor Brown's curiosity was piqued, and he struck up a conversation with James.<br><br>

            As they talked, Doctor Brown realized that James was dealing with a mysterious condition that caused him to hallucinate. Despite his initial reservations, James opened up to Doctor Brown, and the two of them developed a close relationship.<br><br>
            
            Doctor Brown became a trusted confidant for James, offering guidance and support as he navigated the challenges of his condition. And as James's hallucinations became more and more intense, Doctor Brown began to suspect that there might be more to James's experiences than just a simple medical condition.</p>
